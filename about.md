# Synopsis
Biomedical informatics spans a number of domains, such as bio-, clinical-, consumer health-, and public health informatics. As the deluge of data ever increases in these domains, they are oftentimes difficult to interpret and understand. Visualization is a useful tool for representing these data, and as biomedical informaticians it is important to know how to visualize data in an appropriate and meaningful way. In this course, we will study the basic theory of visualization by reading and discussing seminal papers, deconstructing visualizations currently used in biomedicine, and creating our own visualizations.
