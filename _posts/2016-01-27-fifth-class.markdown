Today we continued to learn more about GGPLOT2, and proceeded to get more practice with it.  
The slides are the same from last week. [Slides are available here](/bime591/archive/ggplot_tutorial.html), and in the archive.

We also briefly covered Tableau, and replicated some of the visualizations we made using ggplot2 in Tableau. We also mentioned that Tableau provides student licenses.

Next week, we will have a Skype call with Hadley Wickham, who has graciously agreed to answer some of your ggplot2 design questions!
