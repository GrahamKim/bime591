Today, we had another working group day, continuing from last week. The next class will be a recap of everything we have covered in the class. If you have not already, please please please complete the class evaluations--this feedback is critical for us instructors.

We updated the CSV file from class last week (the public health dataset), as there were some odd endline characters contained within it.

See you next week!
