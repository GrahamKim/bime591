Today, we covered some of the changes in the field since the Shneiderman paper, and then broke out into working groups. We had three working groups, one for each of three areas of biomedical informatics (bioinformatics, clinical informatics, and public health informatics). In each working group, we take biomedical data, design visualizations as a group, and implement them (if we have time). As requested by the class, we will continue where we left off in the working groups next week.

Links from class today:

* [Shneiderman Healthcare Paper](/bime591/archive/Improving health and healthcare with interactive visualization methods.pdf)
* [Ladder of Abstraction](http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/) - I mentioned this blog post to those in the bioinformatics group. It takes about an hour to peruse through, and is well worth it.
* [Clincal dataset](/bime591/archive/sleephealthstudy.csv) - Polysomnography data from the Sleep Heart Health Study via [Physionet](http://physionet.org/physiobank/database/shhpsgdb/). Includes waveform data for things like oxygen saturation, ECG, heart rate, eye movements, and airflow. 
* [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/install) - A list of available datasets are available [here](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/3.3/data/experiment)
* [Public health dataset](/bime591/archive/sortablestats_dot_cdc_dot_gov.csv) - Risk Factors and Health Indicators data from the CDC including death rates, risk factors, and preventable services.
