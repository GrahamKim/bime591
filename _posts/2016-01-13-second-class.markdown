Greetings,

Here below are the links for the tools we viewed in class:
*  Global burden of disease visualizations from IHME: [http://www.healthdata.org/gbd/data-visualizations](http://www.healthdata.org/gbd/data-visualizations)
*  NYT visualizations (need to scroll down to get the data viz: [http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/12/29/us/year-in-interactive-storytelling.html](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/12/29/us/year-in-interactive-storytelling.html)

We spent the first half of class discussing the Shneiderman mantra, and recounting the visualization tools that implement it. During the latter half of class consisted of a lecture on visual encoding, followed by discourse. We will cover biases in data visualizations next week.

The slides and papers from class may be found here:
