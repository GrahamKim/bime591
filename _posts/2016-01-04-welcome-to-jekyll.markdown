Welcome to class. Please check out the [syllabus](/bime591/syllabus) page.

On the first day of class, we will get to know each other and chat a bit about our research interests. We instructors will survey you students to understand your level of experience with visualization and coding. We will also note your desired outcomes from the class. Although we have a syllabus planned and ready to go, we intend to adjust the course content based on your feedback and interests. As a reminder, we meet every Wednesday from 10:00AM-10:50AM at HST360A. This room is a little difficult to find in the health sciences building, so please allow yourself a few minutes to get lost :-D   

See you there!
