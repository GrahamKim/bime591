Today we learned how to create visualizations in R with GGPLOT2 by adding layers.  
We will continue with the GGPLOT2 crash course next week. [Slides are available here](/bime591/archive/ggplot_tutorial.html), and in the archive.

We will also cover Tableau next week, so be sure to have [Tableau installed](http://www.tableau.com/products/desktop) if you want to follow along on your computer.

Here are links we talked about for RColorBrewer, which is a package that gives you color scale options for ordinal, categorical, and continuous data.
