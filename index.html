# BIME 591 -- Biomedical Visualization

Hello class! Welcome to BIME 591 -- Biomedical Visualization. This class is co-instructed by Graham, Uba, and myself, so please feel free to chat with any and all of us! In this course, we will cover some basic visualization theory/practices, go through biomedical visualization examples, interact with guest speakers, and design your own biomedical visualization.

Here below is the current curriculum for the course. Although there are some papers, exercises, or lectures we think are "musts", we are also very open to adjusting the course content based on your feedback:
1. Introduction to visualization (why visualize & Anscombe's quartet paper)
    * Homework - Ben Schneiderman's famous ["Overview"] paper

2. Form groups, discuss dataset to visualize, think about which viz tool to use (GGPLOT2, D3, pen/paper, etc)
   * Go through tutorial on viz tool (Maybe too much to ask of them...)

3. Visualization Design (Overview first, Zoom and Filter, Details on Demand)
   * Homework - Cleveland and McGill paper

4. In-class activity to create first draft of the visualization, applying things learned in class.

5. Visualization Perceptual Accuracy Hierarchy
   * Homework - Find a visualization tool to share with the class

6. In-class activity to create first draft of the visualization, applying things learned in class.

7. Grammar of Graphics
   * Homework - Polaris and Tableau

8. In-class activity to create first draft of the visualization, applying things learned in class.
